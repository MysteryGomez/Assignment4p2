A number is triangular if it is a sum of consecutive integers. For example, 3 = 1+2, 6 = 3+2+1, 10 = 4+3+2+1, ... The first eight triangular numbers are 1,3,6,10, 15,21, 28, and 36.  Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer. The program should then output whether it is a triangular number or not. Include a function to validate the input and a function to test if the input is a triangular number or not.  Hint: find a sum of consecutive integers until it is greater than or equal to the given number. If the sum is equal to the given number then it is a triangular number. Otherwise, it is not.
